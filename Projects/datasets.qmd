## Tips

Here's a few general tips. 

### Importing data
In case you've forgotten, use the `read.csv()` function to import data:

```r
dataset <- read.csv("data/dataset.csv")
```

### Time series data
If you've picked a dataset with time-series data (e.g. a "date" variable), you should transform that column so that it visualises better:

```r
dataset <- dataset %>%
  mutate(time_based_column = as.Date(time_based_column))
```

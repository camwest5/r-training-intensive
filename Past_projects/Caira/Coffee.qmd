A Survey of the Popularity of the 4 types of Coffee Brands 

## Figure = {height = 70%}

```{r}
#| title: The highest consumer of coffee belongs to the age range of 25-34 years old, followed by 35-44 years old. In both age groups, Coffee D was shown to be highly preferred among all brands, with Coffee A in the second lead.

ggplot(data = coffee_overall, 
        mapping = aes(x = age, y = n, fill = prefer_overall)) + 
   geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")

```

```{r}

   filter(!is.na(prefer_abc), 
          !is.na(prefer_ad),

```{r}
 
# trying to expand the table : pivot longer()

coffee_pivot <- pivot_longer(coffee_ranking,cols = 1:4, names_to = "characteristic1", values_to = "ranking")  

# trying to expand the table part 2 : separate_wider_delim(

coffee_separate <- separate_wider_delim(coffee_pivot, characteristic1, delim = "_",

```{r}
#remove the remove column

coffee_bar <- coffee_separate %>% 
  select(coffee, characteristic, ranking) %>% 
  group_by(ranking, coffee, characteristic) %>% 
  summarise(rank_count = n())
```


```{r}
#| title: The participants ranked the characteristics of Coffee D and Coffee A from 1 to 5, with 1 being "less preferred" and 5 being "highly preferred". At a glance, the rankings for both coffees follow a similar trend to each other, with low preference for bitterness with slightly stronger acidity.  However, the bitterness in Coffee A was observed to be ranked higher compared to Coffee D, which can be hypothesized as the reason for Coffee D to be more favoured over Coffee A.  

ggplot(data = coffee_bar, 
       mapping = aes(x = ranking, y = rank_count, colour = coffee, linetype = characteristic)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)

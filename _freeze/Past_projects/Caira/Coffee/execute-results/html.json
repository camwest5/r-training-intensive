At a glance, the rankings for both coffees follow a similar trend to each other, with low preference for bitterness with slightly stronger acidity.  However, the bitterness in Coffee A was observed to be ranked higher compared to Coffee D, which can be hypothesized as the reason for Coffee D to be more favoured over Coffee A.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Coffee_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",

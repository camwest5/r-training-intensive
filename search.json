    "section": "Directing traffic with conditionals",
    "text": "Directing traffic with conditionals\nIn the first half of this session we’ll look at two types of control flows: conditionals and loops.\nConditionals allow you to put “gates” in your code, only running sections if a certain condition is true. They are common to most programming languages.\nIn R, they are called if statements, because you use the if command. For example,\n\nif (5 &gt; 0) {\n  print(\"We're inside the if statement\")\n}\n\n[1] \"We're inside the if statement\"\n\n\nThe line print(\"We're inside the if statement\") will only run if 5 &gt; 0 is true. If not, it’ll get skipped.\nCurly brackets are essential. Only code inside them will be governed by conditional\n\nif (5 &gt; 0) {\n  print(\"We're inside the if statement\")\n}\n\n[1] \"We're inside the if statement\"\n\nprint(\"This code always runs\")\n\n[1] \"This code always runs\"\n\n\nWatch what happens if we change the condition\n\nif (5 &gt; 10) {\n  print(\"We're inside the if statement\")\n}\n\nprint(\"This code always runs\")\n\n[1] \"This code always runs\"\n\n\nNow, the first line doesn’t run. That’s the essence of a conditional.\nThere’s not much point to using a condition that will always be true. Typically, you’d use a variable in the condition, for example.\n\npet_age &lt;- 10\n\nif (pet_age &gt; 10) {\n  print(\"My pet is older than 10\")\n}\n\n\nLogical operators\nHere is a table of the different operators you can make conditions with. When you run them, they always return either True or False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nTrue example\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n==\n10 == 10\nSame value and type\n\n\n!=\n\"10\" != 10\nDifferent value or type\n\n\n&gt;\n10 &gt; 5\nGreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\n10 &gt;= 10\nGreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\n5 &lt; 10\nLess than\n\n\n&lt;=\n5 &lt;= 10\nLess than or equal to\n\n\n&&\n10 == 10 && \"apple\" == \"apple\"\nOnly true if both conditions are true.\n\n\n||\n10 == 10 || \"a\" == \"b\"\nAlways true if one condition is true.\n\n\n\n\n\nelif and else\nif statements only run if the condition is True. What happens if its False? That’s what the else command is for, it’s like a net that catches anything that slipped past if:\n\npet_age &lt;- 5\n\nif (pet_age &gt; 10) {\n  print(\"My pet is older than 10\")\n} else {\n  print(\"My pet is 10 or younger\")\n}\n\n[1] \"My pet is 10 or younger\"\n\n\n\nelse also needs curly brackets!\n\nCheck what happens when you change the age from 5 to 15.\nFinally, what if you wanted to check another condition only if the first one fails? That’s what else if is for. It’s another if statement but it only runs if the first fails.\n\npet_age = 5\n\nif (pet_age &gt; 10) {\n  print(\"My pet is older than 10\")\n} else if (pet_age &lt; 5) {\n  print(\"My pet is younger than 5\")\n} else {\n  print(\"My pet is 10 or younger\")\n}\n\n[1] \"My pet is 10 or younger\"\n\n\nYou can include as many as you’d like\n\npet_age = 5\n\nif (pet_age &gt; 10) {\n  print(\"My pet is older than 10\")\n} else if (pet_age &lt; 5) {\n  print(\"My pet is younger than 5\")\n} else if (pet_age &lt; 1) {\n  print(\"My pet is freshly born\")\n} else {\n  print(\"My pet is 10 or younger\")\n}\n\n[1] \"My pet is 10 or younger\"",

    "text": "Repeat after me\nSometimes you need to repeat a task multiple times. Sometimes hundreds. Maybe you need to loop through 1 million pieces of data. Not fun.\nR’s loops offer us a way to run a section of code multiple times. There are two types: for loops, which run the code once for each element in a sequence (like a list or string), and while loops, which run until some condition is false.\n\nwhile loops\nThese are almost the same as if statements, except for the fact that they run the code multiple times. Let’s begin with a basic conditional\n\nnumber &lt;- 1\n\nif (number &lt; 5) {\n  paste(number, \"is less than 10.\")\n}\n\n[1] \"1 is less than 10.\"\n\n\n\nThe paste function lets you print multiple things together\n\nWhat if we wanted to check all the numbers between 5 and 10? We can use a while loop.\n\nnumber &lt;- 1\n\nwhile (number &lt; 5) {\n  print(paste(number, \"is less than 10.\"))\n  number &lt;- number + 1\n}\n\n[1] \"1 is less than 10.\"\n[1] \"2 is less than 10.\"\n[1] \"3 is less than 10.\"\n[1] \"4 is less than 10.\"\n\n\n\nWe need to include paste inside print because we’re doing it multiple times.\n\nWe’ve done two things\n\nReplace if with while\nIntroduce number = number + 1 to increase the number each time.\n\n\nWithout step 2, we’d have an infinite loop – one that never stops, because the condition would always be true!\n\nWhile loops are useful for repeating code an indeterminate number of times.\n\n\nfor loops\nRealistically, you’re most likely to use a for loop. They’re inherently safer (you can’t have an infinite loop) and often handier.\nIn R, for loops iterate through a sequence, like the objects in a list. This is more like other languages’ foreach, than most’s for.\nLet’s say you have a vector of different fruit\n\nlist_of_fruits &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n\nand you want to run a section of code on \"apple\", then \"banana\", then \"cherry\". Maybe you want to know which ones have the letter “a”. We can start with a for loop\n\nlist_of_fruits &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n\nfor (fruit in list_of_fruits) {\n  print(fruit)\n}\n\n[1] \"apple\"\n[1] \"banana\"\n[1] \"cherry\"\n\n\nThis loop’s job is to print out the variable fruit. But where is fruit defined? Well, the for loop runs print(fruit) for every element of list_of_fruits, storing the current element in the variable fruit. If we were to write it out explicitly, it would look like\n\nfruit &lt;- list_of_fruits[0]\nprint(fruit)\n\ncharacter(0)\n\nfruit &lt;- list_of_fruits[1]\nprint(fruit)\n\n[1] \"apple\"\n\nfruit &lt;- list_of_fruits[2]\nprint(fruit)\n\n[1] \"banana\"\n\n\nLet’s return to our goal: working out which ones have an “a”. We need to put a conditional inside the loop:\n\nlist_of_fruits &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n\nfor (fruit in list_of_fruits) {\n    if (grepl(\"a\", fruit)) { \n      print(paste(\"a is in\", fruit))\n    }\n    else {\n      print(paste(\"a is not in\", fruit))\n    }\n}\n\n[1] \"a is in apple\"\n[1] \"a is in banana\"\n[1] \"a is not in cherry\"\n\n\nFinally, it’s often convenient to loop through a list of numbers. R makes this easy with the x:y notation:\n\n1:10\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\ncontains all the integers between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\). To loop through each,\n\nfor (i in 1:10) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n[1] 6\n[1] 7\n[1] 8\n[1] 9\n[1] 10\n\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that we can loop through many numbers:\n\nfor (i in 1:1000) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\nThis can be useful if you need to loop through multiple objects by indexing. We’ll spare you the output here.\n\n\nMapping with purrr\nConsider the follow situation. You have a dataset, and want to apply a function to every column. Or maybe some columns. What to do?\nYou could loop over them with a for loop. Alternatively, you could use the mapping functions in purrr, which simplifies the code.\nWhat is a map? Generally, a map takes something and makes it something else. So far, that’s the same a function. The difference is that a map takes lots of things and translates them all in the same way. For example, a geographical map takes life-sized locations and transforms them all in the same way to a hand-sized piece of paper.\nEssentially, maps are a way of transforming a selection of variables in the same way. We’ll start by brining in the purrr library\n\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nLet’s use the same data as in the statistics session:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nplayers &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Players2024.csv\")\nplayers &lt;- players %&gt;% filter(positions != \"Missing\", height_cm &gt; 100)\n\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nWhat if you want the median value from all columns? We can use the map_dbl() function to map doubles (long decimal numbers):\n\nmap_dbl(players, median)\n\nWarning in mean.default(sort(x, partial = half + 0L:1L)[half + 0L:1L]):\nargument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\nWarning in mean.default(sort(x, partial = half + 0L:1L)[half + 0L:1L]):\nargument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\nWarning in mean.default(sort(x, partial = half + 0L:1L)[half + 0L:1L]):\nargument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\nWarning in mean.default(sort(x, partial = half + 0L:1L)[half + 0L:1L]):\nargument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\nWarning in mean.default(sort(x, partial = half + 0L:1L)[half + 0L:1L]):\nargument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n       name  birth_date   height_cm   positions nationality         age \n         NA          NA         183          NA          NA          25 \n       club \n         NA \n\n\nDon’t worry about the warnings - they’re just there because you can’t take the median of a non-numeric variable. To check which ones are, we can map the logical operator is.numeric:\n\nmap_lgl(players, is.numeric)\n\n       name  birth_date   height_cm   positions nationality         age \n      FALSE       FALSE        TRUE       FALSE       FALSE        TRUE \n       club \n      FALSE \n\n\nWe can use the pipe here,\n\nplayers %&gt;% map_lgl(is.numeric)\n\n       name  birth_date   height_cm   positions nationality         age \n      FALSE       FALSE        TRUE       FALSE       FALSE        TRUE \n       club \n      FALSE \n\n\nLet’s select the numeric columns and look at the medians again\n\nplayers %&gt;% \n  select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;%\n  map_dbl(median)\n\nheight_cm       age \n      183        25 \n\n\nWe can also create custom functions. We use .x to refer to the variable:\n\nplayers %&gt;% \n  select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;%\n  map_dbl(~max(.x) - min(.x))\n\nheight_cm       age \n       46        27",

    "text": "Building your own machines\nWe’ll wrap this session up by looking at custom functions. So far, we’ve only used built-in functions or those from other people’s modules. But we can make our own!\nWe’ve only ever called functions - this is what we do when we use them. All functions need a definition, this is the code that gets run when they’re called.\n\nThe function definition\nFunctions are machines. They take some inputs, run some code with those inputs, and spit out one output. We need to define how they work before we use them. We should specify\n\nA name\nSome inputs\nThe code to run (the machine itself)\n\nWe include these in three steps\n\nThe first line of the function definition (the function signature) specifies the name and inputs\nWe then indent all the code we want to run with our inputs\nWe end with a return statement, specifying the output\n\n\ninsert_function_name_here &lt;- function(input_1_name, input_2_name, ...) {\n  # Code code code\n}\n\nFor example, let’s create a function that converts centimetres to metres.\n\ncm_to_m &lt;- function(value_in_cm) {\n    value_in_cm / 100\n}\n\nTaking it apart, we have\n\nName: cm_to_m\nInputs (just one): value_in_cm\nCode (just one line): value_in_cm / 100\n\nImportantly, nothing appears when you run this code. Why? Because you’ve only defined the function, you haven’t used it yet.\nTo use this function, we need to call it. Let’s convert \\(10\\text{ cm}\\) to \\(\\text{m}\\).\n\ncm_to_m &lt;- function(value_in_cm) {\n    value_in_cm / 100\n}\n\ncm_to_m(10)\n\n[1] 0.1\n\n\nWhen we call the function, it runs with value_in_cm &lt;- 10.\nThat’s it! Every function that you use, built-in or imported, looks like this.\nBecause functions must be defined before called, and defining them produces no output, best practice is to place functions at the top of your script, below the import statements.\n\nReturn values and default values\nOne quirk of R functions is that, by default, they return the output of the line. Let’s add a new line that prints the message “\\(x\\text{ cm} = y\\text{ m}\\)”. We’ll need to also save our calculation in the process:\n\ncm_to_m &lt;- function(value_in_cm) {\n    value_in_m &lt;- value_in_cm / 100\n    print(paste(value_in_cm, \"cm =\", value_in_m, \"m\"))\n}\n\ncm_to_m(10)\n\n[1] \"10 cm = 0.1 m\"\n\n\nIt works, but we have a problem. The output of the function is the whole message, not the value. The easiest way to fix this is to call the output on the last line:\n\ncm_to_m &lt;- function(value_in_cm) {\n    value_in_m &lt;- value_in_cm / 100\n    print(paste(value_in_cm, \"cm =\", value_in_m, \"m\"))\n    value_in_m\n}\n\ncm_to_m(10)\n\n[1] \"10 cm = 0.1 m\"\n\n\n[1] 0.1\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use the return() function to exit before the end and manually specify the output.",

    "section": "Quarto",
    "text": "Quarto\nQuarto is a publishing system that allows creating documents, presentations, websites and dashboards that contain prose, code and code outputs. This means that such outputs can detail exactly what happened to the data, and outputs can be re-generated very quickly if, for example, the underlying dataset was updated, or if the analysis needs to change.\nLet’s create a document using some of the syntax we learned in previous sessions.\nUse “New File &gt; Quarto Document…” to create a .qmd file. The dialog that open allows us to change a few settings. Let’s give the title “Reproducible Output”, and untick “Use visual markdown editor” so we can learn about the syntax. Save the new file in your project directory.\nThis new .rmd script will be made of markdown text and code chunks. Code chunks can be inserted with the editor pane’s toolbar or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I.\nAt the top of our script, we need to include a header (also called “front matter”) that contains the document’s settings. We can start with:\n---\ntitle: Reproducible Output\nauthor: Your Name\ndate: 2025-01-01\n---\nThe rest of the document will be a mix of markdown-formatted prose and executable code chunks. For example:\n## Import the data\n\nLet's **import** the data:\n\n```{r}\nplayers &lt;- read.csv(\"data_sources/Players2024.csv\")\n```\n\n## Prepare the data\n\nRemove missing position and ensure **reasonable heights**:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nplayers &lt;- players %&gt;% filter(positions != \"Missing\", height_cm &gt; 100)\n```\n\n## Plot the data\n\nA boxplot of player **height by position**:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(players, aes(x = positions, y = height_cm)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Position\", y = \"Height (cm)\")\n```\nOutside the code chunks, we use the Markdown markup language to format the text. For example, using ## before some text defines a heading of level 2 (level 1 being the document’s title), and using ** around some text makes it bold. See more Markdown hints in the Quarto documentation.\n\nRendering\nTo render the document and see the result, use the “Render” button in the source pane toolbar.\nThis should create a HTML document in your project directory, which you can open in a web browser by clicking it and choosing “View in web browser” (if it is not opened automatically already). The file can be left open and will automatically update in your browser when the document is rendered again.\nAs the default Quarto output is a HTML file, we can include interactive visualisations too.\n\n\nCell options\nIf you want to show the code but don’t want to run it, you can add the cell option #| eval: false. And if you want to show the output but not show the underlying code, use #| echo: false.\n\n## Interactive plots\n\nWe need plotly. If you need to install it:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\ninstall.packages(\"plotly\")\n```\n\nAn interactive scartterplot:\n\n```{r}\n#| title: Age vs Height\n#| echo: false\n\np &lt;- ggplot(players, aes(x = age, y = height_cm, colour = positions, label = name, label2 = nationality)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(vars(positions)) + \n  labs(x = \"Age\", colour = \"Position\", y = \"Height (cm)\")\nlibrary(plotly)\nggplotly(p)\n```\nAnd for adding a caption and alternative text to a figure, we can modify our boxplot chunk as follows:\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: \"Goalkeepers tend to be taller.\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A boxplot of the relationship between height and position.\"\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(players, aes(x = positions, y = height_cm)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Position\", y = \"Height (cm)\")\n```\nMany more cell options exist, including captioning and formatting visualisations. Note that these options can be used at the cell level as well as globally (by modifying the front matter at the top of the document).\nFor example, to make sure error and warning messages are never shown:\n---\ntitle: Reproducible Output\nauthor: Your Name\ndate: 2025-01-01\nwarning: false\nerror: false\n---\n\n\nOutput formats\nThe default output format in Quarto is HTML, which is by far the most flexible. However, Quarto is a very versatile publishing system and can generate many different output formats, including PDF, DOCX and ODT, slide formats, Markdown suited for GitHub… and even whole blogs, books and dashboards.\nLet’s try rendering a PDF:\n---\ntitle: Reproducible Output\nauthor: Your Name\ndate: 2025-01-01\nformat: pdf\n---\nWhen rendering PDFs, the first issue we might run into is the lack of a LaTeX distribution. If Quarto didn’t detect one, it will suggest to install tinytex (a minimal LaTeX distribution) with this terminal command:\nquarto install tinytex\nOnce that is installed, Quarto should render a PDF.\nAnother issue with our example document is that an interactive HTML visualisation won’t be rendered in the PDF. You can suppress it by using the #| eval: false option:\n```{r}\n#| title: Age vs Height\n#| echo: false\n#| eval: false\np &lt;- ggplot(players, aes(x = age, y = height_cm, colour = positions, label = name, label2 = nationality)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(vars(positions)) + \n  labs(x = \"Age\", colour = \"Position\", y = \"Height (cm)\")\nlibrary(plotly)\nggplotly(p)\n```",

    "section": "Basic dplyr verbs",
    "text": "Basic dplyr verbs\nThe R package dplyr was developed by Hadley Wickham for data manipulation.\nThe book R for Data Science introduces the package as follows:\n\nYou are going to learn the five key dplyr functions that allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges:\n\nPick variables by their names with select()\nPick observations by their values with filter()\nReorder the rows with arrange()\nCreate new variables with functions of existing variables with mutate()\nCollapse many values down to a single summary with summarise()\n\nThese can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the main verbs for a language of data manipulation.\n\nTo use the verbs to their full extent, we will use pipes and logical operators, which we will introduce as we go.\nLet’s load the dplyr package to access its functions:\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nYou only need to install a package once (with install.packages()), but you need to reload it every time you start a new R session (with library()).\n\n\n1. Pick variables with select()\nselect() allows us to pick variables (i.e. columns) from the dataset. For example, to only keep the data about year, country and GDP per capita:\ngap_small &lt;- select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap)\nThe first argument refers to the dataframe that is being transformed, and the following arguments are the columns you want to keep. Notice that it keeps the order you specified?\nYou can also rename columns in the same command:\ngap_small &lt;- select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPerPerson = gdpPercap)\nIf you have many variables but only want to remove a small number, it might be better to deselect instead of selecting. You can do that by using the - character in front of a variable name:\nnames(select(gapminder, -continent))\n[1] \"country\"   \"year\"      \"pop\"       \"lifeExp\"   \"gdpPercap\"\nThere are also a lot of helper functions to select columns according to a logic. For example, to only keep the columns that have “a” in their names:\nnames(select(gapminder, contains(\"a\")))\n[1] \"year\"      \"gdpPercap\"\n\n\n2. Pick observations with filter()\nThe filter() function allows use to pick observations depending on one or several conditions. But to be able to define these conditions, we need to learn about logical operators.\nLogical operators allow us to compare things. Here are some of the most important ones:\n\n==: equal\n!=: different or not equal\n&gt;: greater than\n&lt;: smaller than\n&gt;=: greater or equal\n&lt;=: smaller or equal\n\n\nRemember: = is used to pass on a value to an argument, whereas == is used to check for equality. Using = instead of == for a logical statment is one of the most common errors and R will give you a reminder in the console when this happens.\n\nFor example, to filter the observations for Australia, we can use the following condition:\naustralia &lt;- filter(gapminder, country == \"Australia\")\naustralia\n# A tibble: 12 × 6\n   country    year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Australia  1952  8691212 Oceania      69.1    10040.\n 2 Australia  1957  9712569 Oceania      70.3    10950.\n 3 Australia  1962 10794968 Oceania      70.9    12217.\n 4 Australia  1967 11872264 Oceania      71.1    14526.\n 5 Australia  1972 13177000 Oceania      71.9    16789.\n 6 Australia  1977 14074100 Oceania      73.5    18334.\n 7 Australia  1982 15184200 Oceania      74.7    19477.\n 8 Australia  1987 16257249 Oceania      76.3    21889.\n 9 Australia  1992 17481977 Oceania      77.6    23425.\n10 Australia  1997 18565243 Oceania      78.8    26998.\n11 Australia  2002 19546792 Oceania      80.4    30688.\n12 Australia  2007 20434176 Oceania      81.2    34435.\nThe function compares the value “Australia” to all the values in the country variable, and only keeps the rows that have TRUE as an answer.\nNow, let’s filter the rows that have a life expectancy lifeExp greater than 81 years:\nlife81 &lt;- filter(gapminder, lifeExp &gt; 81)\ndim(life81)\n[1] 7 6\n\n\n3. Reorder observations with arrange()\narrange() will reorder our rows according to a variable, by default in ascending order:\narrange(life81, lifeExp)\n# A tibble: 7 × 6\n  country          year       pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Australia        2007  20434176 Oceania      81.2    34435.\n2 Hong Kong China  2002   6762476 Asia         81.5    30209.\n3 Switzerland      2007   7554661 Europe       81.7    37506.\n4 Iceland          2007    301931 Europe       81.8    36181.\n5 Japan            2002 127065841 Asia         82      28605.\n6 Hong Kong China  2007   6980412 Asia         82.2    39725.\n7 Japan            2007 127467972 Asia         82.6    31656.\nIf we want to have a look at the entries with highest life expectancy first, we can use the desc() function (for “descending”):\narrange(life81, desc(lifeExp))\n# A tibble: 7 × 6\n  country          year       pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Japan            2007 127467972 Asia         82.6    31656.\n2 Hong Kong China  2007   6980412 Asia         82.2    39725.\n3 Japan            2002 127065841 Asia         82      28605.\n4 Iceland          2007    301931 Europe       81.8    36181.\n5 Switzerland      2007   7554661 Europe       81.7    37506.\n6 Hong Kong China  2002   6762476 Asia         81.5    30209.\n7 Australia        2007  20434176 Oceania      81.2    34435.\n\nThe pipe operator\nWhat if we wanted to get that result in one single command, without an intermediate life81 object?\nWe could nest the commands into each other, the first step as the first argument of the second step:\narrange(filter(gapminder, lifeExp &gt; 81), desc(lifeExp))\n… but this becomes very hard to read, very quickly. (Imagine with 3 steps or more!)\nWe can make our code more readable and avoid creating useless intermediate objects by piping commands into each other. The pipe operator %&gt;% strings commands together, using the left side’s output as the first argument of the right side function.\nFor example, this command:\ngapminder %&gt;%\n  filter(lifeExp &gt; 81) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(lifeExp))\n… is equivalent to:\narrange(filter(gapminder, lifeExp &gt; 81), desc(lifeExp))\nThe pipe operator can be read as “then” and makes the code a lot more readable than when nesting functions into each other, and avoids the creation of several intermediate objects. It is also easier to troubleshoot as it makes it easy to execute the pipeline step by step.\nFrom now on, we’ll use the pipe syntax as a default.\n\nNote that this material uses the magrittr pipe. The magrittr package is the one that introduced the pipe operator to the R world, and dplyr automatically imports this useful operator when it is loaded. However, the pipe being such a widespread and popular concept in programming and data science, it ended up making it into Base R (the “native” pipe) in 2021 with the release of R 4.1, using a different operator: |&gt;. You can switch your pipe shortcut to the native pipe in Tools &gt; Global options &gt; Code &gt; Use native pipe operator.\n\n\n\n\n4. Create new variables with mutate()\nHave a look at what the verb mutate() can do with ?mutate.\nLet’s see what the two following variables can be used for:\ngapminder %&gt;%\n    select(gdpPercap, pop)\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 2\n   gdpPercap      pop\n       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      779.  8425333\n 2      821.  9240934\n 3      853. 10267083\n 4      836. 11537966\n 5      740. 13079460\n 6      786. 14880372\n 7      978. 12881816\n 8      852. 13867957\n 9      649. 16317921\n10      635. 22227415\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\nHow do you think we could combine them to add something new to our dataset?\nWe can use mutate() to create a gdp variable that tells us the total gdp.\nName your new dataset gap_gdp. When finished, dim(gap_gdp) should result in 1704 7.\nHint: use the * operator within mutate() to multiply the pop by gdpPercap.\ngap_gdp &lt;- gapminder %&gt;%\n    mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop)\ndim(gap_gdp)\n[1] 1704    7\nhead(gap_gdp)\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap          gdp\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333 Asia         28.8      779.  6567086330.\n2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934 Asia         30.3      821.  7585448670.\n3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083 Asia         32.0      853.  8758855797.\n4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966 Asia         34.0      836.  9648014150.\n5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460 Asia         36.1      740.  9678553274.\n6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372 Asia         38.4      786. 11697659231.\nYou can reuse a variable computed by ‘mutate()’ straight away. For example, we also want a more readable version of our new variable, in billion dollars:\ngap_gdp &lt;- gapminder %&gt;%\n    mutate(gdp = gdpPercap * pop,\n           gdpBil = gdp / 1e9)\n\n\n5. Collapse to a single value with summarise()\nsummarise() collapses many values down to a single summary. For example, to find the mean life expectancy for the whole dataset:\ngapminder %&gt;%\n  summarise(meanLE = mean(lifeExp))\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  meanLE\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   59.5\nHowever, a single-value summary is not particularly interesting. summarise() becomes more powerful when used with group_by().\n\n\n6. Change the scope with group_by()\ngroup_by() changes the scope of the following function(s) from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group.\nSee the effect of the grouping step:\ngapminder %&gt;%\n    group_by(continent)\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n   country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333 Asia         28.8      779.\n 2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934 Asia         30.3      821.\n 3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083 Asia         32.0      853.\n 4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966 Asia         34.0      836.\n 5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460 Asia         36.1      740.\n 6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372 Asia         38.4      786.\n 7 Afghanistan  1982 12881816 Asia         39.9      978.\n 8 Afghanistan  1987 13867957 Asia         40.8      852.\n 9 Afghanistan  1992 16317921 Asia         41.7      649.\n10 Afghanistan  1997 22227415 Asia         41.8      635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\nThe data in the cells is the same, the size of the object is the same. However, the dataframe was converted to a tibble, because a dataframe is not capable of storing grouping information.\nUsing the group_by() function before summarising makes things more interesting. Let’s re-run the previous command, with the intermediate grouping step:\ngapminder %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent) %&gt;% \n  summarise(meanLE = mean(lifeExp))\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  continent meanLE\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa      48.9\n2 Americas    64.7\n3 Asia        60.1\n4 Europe      71.9\n5 Oceania     74.3\nWe now have the summary computed for each continent.\nSimilarly, to find out the total population per continent in 2007, we can do the following:\ngapminder %&gt;% \n    filter(year == 2007) %&gt;%\n    group_by(continent) %&gt;%\n    summarise(pop = sum(pop))\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  continent        pop\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa     929539692\n2 Americas   898871184\n3 Asia      3811953827\n4 Europe     586098529\n5 Oceania     24549947",

They are useful for:\n\nsaving a set of commands for later use (and executing it in one click)\nmaking research reproducible\nmaking writing and reading code more comfortable\ndocumenting the code with comments, and\nsharing your work with peers\n\nLet’s create a new R script with the menu: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. (This can also be done with the first icon in the toolbar, or with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+N.)\nThis opens our fourth pane in the top left of RStudio: the source pane.\n\nComments\nWe should start with a couple of comments, to document our script. Comments start with #, and will be ignored by R:\n# Description: Introduction to R and RStudio\n# Author: &lt;your name&gt;\n# Date: &lt;today's date&gt;\n\n\nSyntax highlighting\nNow, add some commands to your script:\n\nnum1 &lt;- 42\nnum2 &lt;- num1 / 9\n\nNotice the colours? This is called syntax highlighting. This is one of the many ways RStudio makes it more comfortable to work with R. The code is more readable when working in a script.\n\nWhile editing your script, you can run the current command (or the selected block of code) by using Ctrl+Enter. Remember to save your script regularly with the shortcut Ctrl+S. You can find more shortcuts with Alt+Shift+K, or the menu “Tools &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts Help”.",

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nAn R function is a little program that does a particular job. It usually looks like this:\n&lt;functionname&gt;(&lt;argument(s)&gt;)\nArguments tell the function what to do. Some functions don’t need arguments, others need one or several, but they always need the parentheses after their name.\nFor example, try running the following command:\n\nround(num2)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe round() function rounds a number to the closest integer. The only argument we give it is num2, the number we want to round.\n\nIf you scroll back to the top of your console, you will now be able to spot functions in the text.\n\n\nHelp\nWhat if we want to learn more about a function?\nThere are two main ways to find help about a specific function in RStudio:\n\nthe shortcut command: ?functionname\nthe keyboard shortcut: press F1 with your cursor in a function name (you can do this by simply clicking on the function name)\n\nLet’s look through the documentation for the round() function:\n?round\nAs you can see, different functions might share the same documentation page.\nThere is quite a lot of information in a function’s documentation, but the most important bits are:\n\nDescription: general description of the function(s)\nUsage: overview of what syntax can be used\nArguments: description of what each argument is\nExamples: some examples that demonstrate what is possible\n\nSee how the round() function has a second argument available? Try this now:\n\nround(num2, digits = 2)\n\n[1] 4.67\n\n\nWe can change the default behaviour of the function by telling it how many digits we want after the decimal point, using the argument digits. And if we use the arguments in order, we don’t need to name them:\n\nround(num2, 2)\n\n[1] 4.67\n\n\nTo group values together in a single object, use the c() function.\nc() combines the arguments into a vector. In other words, it takes any number of arguments (hence the ...), and stores all those values together, as one single object. For example, let’s store the ages of our pet dogs in a new object:\n\nages &lt;- c(4, 10, 2, NA, 3)\n\n\nYou can store missing data as NA.\n\nWe can now reuse this vector, and calculate their human age:\n\nages * 7\n\n[1] 28 70 14 NA 21\n\n\nR can create visualisations with functions too. Try a bar plot of your dogs’ ages with the barplot() function:\n\nbarplot(ages)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can customise the plot with a title and some colours, for example:\n\nbarplot(ages, main = \"How old are my dogs?\", col = \"pink\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 1 – Finding help\nUse the help pages to find out what these functions do, and try executing commands with them:\n\nrep.int()\nmean()\nrm()\n\nrep.int() creates vectors like c(), but it is designed to easily replicate values. For example, if you find something very funny:\n\nrep.int(\"Ha!\", 30)\n\n [1] \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\"\n[13] \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\"\n[25] \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\" \"Ha!\"\n\n\nThe next function, mean(), returns the mean of a vector of numbers:\n\nmean(ages)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nWhat happened there?\nWe have an NA value in the vector, which means the function can’t tell what the mean is. If we want to change this default behaviour, we can use an extra argument: na.rm, which stands for “remove NAs”.\n\nmean(ages, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4.75\n\n\n\nIn our last command, if we hadn’t named the na.rm argument, R would have understood TRUE to be the value for the trim argument!\n\nrm() removes an object from your environment (remove() and rm() point to the same function). For example:\n\nrm(num1)\n\n\nR does not check if you are sure you want to remove something! As a programming language, it does what you ask it to do, which means you might have to be more careful. But you’ll see later on that, when working with scripts, this is less of a problem.\n\nLet’s do some more complex operations by combining two functions:\nls() returns a character vector: it contains the names of all the objects in the current environment (i.e. the objects we created in this R session). Notice that this function doesn’t require us to provide any argument, but we still need to write the parentheses to run the function.\nIs there a way we could combine ls() with rm()?\nYou can remove all the objects in the environment by using ls() as the value for the list argument:\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\nWe are nesting a function inside another one. More precisely, we are using the output of the ls() function as the value passed on to the list argument in the rm() function.\n\n\n\nIncomplete functions\nIf you don’t finish a function, by leaving off the last bracket ) for example, the line of code won’t necessarily give you an error, but it won’t work very well. If you forget to include that last bracket, R will run the code, and then wait for further instructions before giving you an output. This will appear as a + in the console like so:\n&gt; round(1.23\n+\nIf you try to give any further instructions to R, it will likely just continue giving you + symbols, and not return anything. To stop this, click on the console and press the Esc key on your keyboard.\n\n\nMore help\nWe’ve practised how to find help about functions we know the name of. What if we don’t know what the function is called? Or if we want general help about R?\n\nThe function help.start() is a good starting point: it opens a browser of official R help.\nIf you want to search for a word in all the documentation, you can use the ?? syntax. For example, try executing ??anova.\nFinally, you will often go to your web browser and search for a particular question, or a specific error message: most times, there already is an answer somewhere on the Internet. The challenge is to ask the right question!",

We need to tell ggplot2 what we want to visualise, by mapping aesthetic elements (like our axes) to variables from the data. We want to visualise how common different conservations statuses are, so let’s associate the right variable to the x axis:\n\nggplot(data = msleep,\n       mapping = aes(x = conservation))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 has done what we asked it to do: the conservation variable is on the x axis. But nothing is shown on the plot area, because we haven’t defined how to represent the data, with a geometry_* function:\n\nggplot(data = msleep,\n       mapping = aes(x = conservation)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a useful plot: we can see that a lot of animals in this dataset don’t have a conservation status, and that “least concern” is the next most common value.\nWe can see our three essential elements in the code:\n\nthe data comes from the msleep object;\nthe variable conservation is mapped to the aesthetic x (i.e. the x axis);\nthe geometry is \"bar\", for “bar chart”.\n\nHere, we don’t need to specify what variable is associated to the y axis, as the “bar” geometry automatically does a count of the different values in the conservation variable. That is what statistics are applied automatically to the data.\n\nIn ggplot2, each geometry has default statistics, so we often don’t need to specify which stats we want to use. We could use a stat_*() function instead of a geom_*() function, but most people start with the geometry (and let ggplot2 pick the default statistics that are applied).",

You can copy it straight to your clipboard, and paste it into it.\nA PDF is a good, quick option to export an easily shareable file with vector graphics. Try for example the “A5” size, the “Landscape” orientation, and save it into your “plots” directory.\nMore options are available in the “Save as image…” option. PNG is a good compressed format for graphics, but if you want to further customise your visualisation in a different program, use SVG or EPS, which are vector formats. (Try to open an SVG file in Inkscape for example.)\n\nTo save the last plot with a command, you can use the ggsave() function:\n\nggsave(filename = \"plots/fuel_efficiency.png\")\n\nThis is great to automate the export process for each plot in your script, but ggsave() also has extra options, like setting the DPI, which is useful for getting the right resolution for a specific use. For example, to export a plot for your presentation:\n\nggsave(filename = \"plots/fuel_efficiency.png\", dpi = \"screen\")\n\n\nSaving a .svg file with requires installing the svglite package. This packages seems so work best installing in a fresh R session (Session &gt; Restart R) from source install.packages(\"svglite\", type = \"source\"). Then load the library library(svglite) rerun your code including loading previous libraries (ggplot2 etc.) and now saving a plot with a .svg extension should work!\n\nChallenge 2 – add a variable and a smooth line\nLet’s use a similar approach to what we did with the mpg dataset.\nTake our previous unemployment visualisation, but represented with points this time:\n\nggplot(economics,\n       aes(x = date,\n           y = unemploy)) + \n    geom_point()\n\nHow could we:\n\nAdd a smooth line for the number of unemployed people.

(i.e. categorical vs continuous)\n\nThis default “trend line” is not particularly useful. We could make it follow the data more closely by using the span argument. The closer to 0, the closer to the data the smoother will be:\n\nggplot(economics,\n       aes(x = date,\n           y = unemploy)) + \n    geom_point(aes(colour = uempmed)) +\n    geom_smooth(span = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now see why this is called a “smoother”: we can fit a smooth curve to data that varies a lot.\nTo further refine our visualisation, we could visualise the unemployment rate rather than the number of unemployed people, by calculating it straight into our code:\n\nggplot(economics,\n       aes(x = date,\n           y = unemploy / pop)) + \n    geom_point(aes(colour = uempmed)) +\n    geom_smooth(span = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe early 1980s recession now seems to have had a more significant impact on unemployment than the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008.",

Alernatively, you can use any hex value like “#760daa”.\n\n\n\nChange labels\nWe can also modify labels with the labs() function to make our plot more self-explanatory:\n\nggplot(diamonds,\n       aes(x = cut)) + \n    geom_bar(fill = \"tomato\") +\n    labs(title = \"Where are the bad ones?\",\n         x = \"Quality of the cut\",\n         y = \"Number of diamonds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s have a look at what labs() can do:\n\n?labs\n\nIt can edit the title, the subtitle, the x and y axes labels, and the caption.\n\nRemember that captions and titles are better sorted out in the publication itself, especially for accessibility reasons (e.g. to help with screen readers).\n\n\n\nHorizontal bar charts\nFor a horizontal bar chart, we can map the cut variable to the y aesthetic instead of x. But remember to also change your labels around!\n\nggplot(diamonds,\n       aes(y = cut)) + # switch here...\n  geom_bar(fill = \"tomato\") +\n  labs(title = \"Where are the bad ones?\",\n       y = \"Quality of the cut\", # ...but also here!\n       x = \"Number of diamonds\") # ...and here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is particularly helpful when long category names overlap under the x axis.\n\n\nBuilt-in themes\nThe theme() function allows us to really get into the details of our plot’s look, but some theme_*() functions make it easy to apply a built-in theme, like theme_bw():\n\nggplot(diamonds,\n       aes(y = cut)) + \n  geom_bar(fill = \"tomato\") +\n  labs(title = \"Where are the bad ones?\",\n       y = \"Quality of the cut\",\n       x = \"Number of diamonds\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry theme_minimal() as well, and if you want more options, install the ggthemes package!",

We’ll need to use the players$age variable as well.\nThe covariance between “height_cm” and “age” is\n\ncov(players$height_cm, players$age)\n\n[1] 0.5126608\n\n\nSimilarly, we can find the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns.\n\ncor(players$height_cm, players$age)\n\n[1] 0.01682598\n\n\nYou can also specify “kendall” or “spearman” for their respective correlation coefficients\n\ncor(players$height_cm, players$age, method = \"kendall\")\n\n[1] 0.005417946\n\ncor(players$height_cm, players$age, method = \"spearman\")\n\n[1] 0.007604345\n\n\n\n\nReminder about groupbys\nBefore we move to inferential statistics, it’s worth reiterating the power of groupbys discussed in the second workshop.\nTo group by a specific variable, like “positions”, we use\n\nplayers %&gt;% \n    group_by(positions)\n\n# A tibble: 5,932 × 7\n# Groups:   positions [4]\n   name                birth_date height_cm positions  nationality   age club   \n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 James Milner        1986-01-04       175 Midfield   England        38 Bright…\n 2 Anastasios Tsokanis 1991-05-02       176 Midfield   Greece         33 Volou …\n 3 Jonas Hofmann       1992-07-14       176 Midfield   Germany        32 Bayer …\n 4 Pepe Reina          1982-08-31       188 Goalkeeper Spain          42 Calcio…\n 5 Lionel Carole       1991-04-12       180 Defender   France         33 Kayser…\n 6 Ludovic Butelle     1983-04-03       188 Goalkeeper France         41 Stade …\n 7 Daley Blind         1990-03-09       180 Defender   Netherlands    34 Girona…\n 8 Craig Gordon        1982-12-31       193 Goalkeeper Scotland       41 Heart …\n 9 Dimitrios Sotiriou  1987-09-13       185 Goalkeeper Greece         37 Omilos…\n10 Alessio Cragno      1994-06-28       184 Goalkeeper Italy          30 Associ…\n# ℹ 5,922 more rows\n\n\nBy applying our statistics to the group_by object, we’ll apply them to every variable for each position.\n\nplayers %&gt;% \n    group_by(positions) %&gt;% \n    summarise(mean_height = mean(height_cm))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  positions  mean_height\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Attack            181.\n2 Defender          184.\n3 Goalkeeper        191.\n4 Midfield          180.",

    "text": "Inferential Statistics\nWhile descriptive statistics describes the data definitively, inferential statistics aim to produce models for extrapolating conlusions.\n\nSimple linear regressions\nLeast-squares regression for two sets of measurements can be performed with the function lm. Recall that linear regressions have the mathematical form\n\\[ Y = β_1 X + β_0 \\]\nand we use the regression tool to estimate the parameters \\(β_0\\,,β_1\\). We can equivalently say that \\(Y \\sim X\\), which is what R takes in\n\nlm(\"height_cm ~ age\", players)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"height_cm ~ age\", data = players)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          age  \n  182.38260      0.02583  \n\n\nIf we store this as a variable, we can then produce a summary of the results\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(\"height_cm ~ age\", players)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"height_cm ~ age\", data = players)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-23.028  -5.028   0.075   4.978  23.075 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We’ll need to use techniques from the visualisation session. Let’s import ggplot2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nStart by making a scatterplot of the data,\n\nggplot(players, aes(x = height_cm, y = age)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you’ll need to plot the regression as a line. For reference,\n\\[ y = \\text{slope}\\times x + \\text{intercept}\\]\nSo\n\nb0 &lt;- model$coefficients[1]\nb1 &lt;- model$coefficients[2]\n\nggplot(players, aes(x = age, y = height_cm)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_abline(intercept = b0, slope = b1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)-tests\nWe can also perform \\(t\\)-tests. Typically, these are performed to examine the statistical signficance of a difference between two samples’ means. Let’s examine whether that earlier groupby result for is accurate for heights, specifically, are goalkeepers taller than non-goalkeepers?\nLet’s start by creating a new column with the values\n\n\n\nFALSE\nNon-goalkeeper\n\n\nTRUE\nGoalkeeper\n\n\n\n\nplayers &lt;- players %&gt;% \n  mutate(gk = positions == \"Goalkeeper\")\n\nThe \\(t\\)-test’s goal is to check whether \\(\\text{height\\_cm}\\) depends on \\(\\text{gk}\\), so the formula is \\(\\text{height\\_cm}\\sim\\text{gk}\\). This is given to the t.test function:\n\nt.test(height_cm ~ gk, data = players)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  height_cm by gk\nt = -48.817, df = 1274.4, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group FALSE and group TRUE is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -9.036644 -8.338391\nsample estimates:\nmean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE \n           181.9810            190.6685 \n\n\nYielding a p-value of \\(p&lt;2.2\\times10^{-16}\\), indicating that the null-hypothesis (heights are the same) is extremely unlikely.\nTo visualise this result, it might be helpful to produce a histogram of the heights\n\nggplot(players, \n       aes(x = height_cm, fill = gk)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 24)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANOVAs\nWhat about the means of the other three? We could use an ANOVA to examine them. We use the aov() function for this.\nLet’s start by making a new dataset without goalkeepers\n\nno_gk &lt;- players %&gt;% filter(gk == FALSE)\n\nNext, we save the analysis of variance results\n\nres_aov &lt;- aov(height_cm ~ positions, data = no_gk)\n\nAnd examine them with summary()\n\nsummary(res_aov)\n\n              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \npositions      2  15470    7735   199.7 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   5205 201552      39                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nEven without goalkeepers included, it looks like their positions are not all independent of height.\n\n\n\\(\\chi^2\\) tests\n\\(χ^2\\) tests are useful for examining the relationship of categorical variables by comparing the frequencies of each. Often, you’d use this if you can make a contingency table.\nWe only have one useful categorical variable here, “positions” (the others have too many unique values), so we’ll need to create another. Let’s see if there’s a relationship between players’ positions and names with the letter “a”.\nMake a binary column for players with the letter “a” in their names. To do this, we need to apply a string method to all the columns in the dataframe as follows\n\nplayers &lt;- players %&gt;%\n  mutate(a_in_name = grepl(\"a\", name))\n\n\nThe grepl function perform pattern matching: it checks if the pattern \"a\" is inside the values in name.\n\nLet’s cross tabulate positions with this new column\n\ntable(players$positions, players$a_in_name)\n\n            \n             FALSE TRUE\n  Attack       291 1280\n  Defender     355 1606\n  Goalkeeper   149  575\n  Midfield     312 1364\n\n\nThe \\(χ^2\\) test’s job is to examine whether players’ positions depend on the presence of “a” in their name. To evaluate it we need to send the contingency table in:\n\nchisq.test(table(players$positions, players$a_in_name))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table(players$positions, players$a_in_name)\nX-squared = 2.1808, df = 3, p-value = 0.5357\n\n\nAs expected, there is no signifcant relationship. A simple bar plot can help us here\n\nggplot(players,\n       aes(x = positions, fill = a_in_name)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we use the position = \"fill\" parameter to geom_bar, we’ll see each as a proportion\n\nggplot(players,\n       aes(x = positions, fill = a_in_name)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks as though the proportions are much the same.\n\n\nGeneralised linear models\nWe’ll finish by looking at Generalised Linear Models. The distributions they include are\n\nBinomial\nPoisson\nGaussian (Normal)\nGamma\nInverse Gaussian\nA few quasi options\n\nWe’ll use the binomial option to create logistic regressions.\nLogistic regressions examine the distribution of binary data. For us, we can compare the heights of goalkeepers vs non-goalkeepers again.\nNow, we can model this column with height. We’ll do the same as our \\(t\\)-test case, but this time we need to specify that family = binomial to ensure we’ll get a logistic:\n\nres_logistic &lt;- glm(gk ~ height_cm, family = binomial, data = players)\n\nWe can take a look at the results with\n\nsummary(res_logistic)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = gk ~ height_cm, family = binomial, data = players)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(&gt;|z|)    \n(Intercept) -53.23360    1.92714  -27.62   &lt;2e-16 ***\nheight_cm     0.27448    0.01019   26.94   &lt;2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n(Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)\n\n    Null deviance: 4401.4  on 5931  degrees of freedom\nResidual deviance: 3167.0  on 5930  degrees of freedom\nAIC: 3171\n\nNumber of Fisher Scoring iterations: 6\n\n\nAnd we can then visualise it with ggplot2. We need to make another variable, because we need to replace TRUE \\(\\rightarrow\\) 1 and FALSE \\(\\rightarrow\\) 0 for the plot.\n\nplayers &lt;- players %&gt;% mutate(gk_numeric = as.numeric(gk))\n\nNow we can plot the logistic regression. The fitted values (on the \\(y\\)-axis) are stored in res_logistic$fitted.values, but there are no provided \\(x\\)-values - these come from the players dataset. Use geom_point() for the data and geom_line() for the fit:\n\nggplot(players, aes(x = height_cm, y = gk_numeric)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y = res_logistic$fitted.values))",

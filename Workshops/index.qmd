Over these three days we'll cover six sessions of content:

| Session | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [The Fundamentals](./1%20-%20Fundamentals.qmd) | The basics of R. Variables, functions and packages.
| [Data processing](./2%20-%20Data%20processing.md) | Importing, manipulating and analysing data with `dplyr` |
| [Visualisation](./3%20-%20Visualisation.qmd) | Creating visualisations of our data with `ggplot2` |
| [Sharing and Publishing](./4%20-%20Sharing%20and%20Publishing.qmd) | Using GitHub for sharing and version control, as well as quarto for publishing dashboards and websites. |
| [Statistics](./5%20-%20Statistics.qmd) | Descriptive and inferential statistics, with some regressions and hypothesis testing. |
| [Programming Essentials](./6%20-%20Programming.qmd) | R tools everyone should know. Conditionals, loops and functions. |

These content sessions are pretty packed, and we won't have too much time to deviate. That's why we'll also have five project sessions - see [Project Overview](../Projects/details.qmd) for details. You're welcome to ask lengthier questions and play around there!
